# Customer Empathy Map & Personas — Déftar

> **Product:** Déftar — Digital Ledger for Small Retailers in Guinea
> **Market:** Conakry, Guinea (expansion: Kindia, Mamou, Kankan)
> **Date:** February 2026
> **Author:** Ablo — Product Owner

## Executive Summary

Déftar targets the informal retail economy in Guinea — a market of hundreds of thousands of small kiosks, boutiques, and walking vendors (ambulants) that run on handwritten notebooks, mental math, and trust. These retailers are the last-mile distribution point for daily essentials in every neighborhood across Conakry and beyond. They operate with no digital tools, have zero visibility into their daily sales, and lose money to forgotten debts. Déftar replaces their paper notebook with a radically simple mobile sales ledger.

This document defines four primary personas based on field research, market data, and behavioral analysis of similar markets (India's kirana stores, Morocco's traditional retailers, Nigeria's informal kiosks).

## Persona 1: Ibrahima — The Neighborhood Boutiquier

### Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | Ibrahima Diallo |
| **Age** | 38 |
| **Location** | Matoto, Conakry |
| **Ethnicity / Language** | Peul (Fula) — speaks Pular at home, basic Susu for commerce, limited French |
| **Education** | Completed primary school (CE2) — can read numbers but struggles with written French |
| **Business** | Small kiosk (boutique) selling daily essentials: rice, oil, sugar, milk, bread, phone credit, candles, batteries |
| **Revenue** | ~2-4 million GNF/month (~$230-460 USD) |
| **Phone** | Itel A18, Android Go, 1GB RAM, cracked screen, shared charger with neighbor |
| **Connectivity** | Prepaid Orange data — buys 500MB bundles, often runs out by mid-week |
| **Mobile Money** | Has Orange Money account, uses it mainly to receive transfers from family in Labé |
| **Family** | Married, 4 children, wife sells fried food in front of the kiosk |

### Empathy Map

#### 👁️ SEES

- Customers coming in 5-15 times per day, many buying on credit ("je te paie demain")
- His paper notebook getting dirty, pages torn, ink fading in the heat
- Other boutiquiers in the neighborhood losing money because customers deny debts
- Young people in the neighborhood using smartphones for WhatsApp and TikTok
- Orange Money agents doing business digitally in the market
- His own children using phones more comfortably than he does

#### 👂 HEARS

- Customers saying "I already paid you last week" when he knows they didn't
- His wife complaining they can't track how much money the kiosk actually makes
- Radio ads for Orange Money and banking products he doesn't qualify for
- Other shopkeepers talking about how much credit they've lost this month
- His brother in Dakar telling him about apps shopkeepers use there
- The Imam at Friday prayers reminding people to honor their debts

#### 💭 THINKS & BELIEVES

- "I know I'm losing money but I don't know exactly how much"
- "If I refuse credit, customers will go to the next boutique"
- "I can't embarrass my neighbor by asking for money too aggressively"
- "Technology is for educated people, not for someone like me"
- "My phone is just for calls and WhatsApp — I don't know how to use complicated apps"
- "I don't trust putting my business information on the internet"
- "If I could just prove what people owe me, I'd recover a lot of money"

#### 😔 FEELS (Pain Points)

- **Frustration** — Loses an estimated 15-25% of credit sales to disputed or forgotten debts
- **Anxiety** — Has no clear picture of daily profit vs. loss; doesn't know if the business is growing or shrinking
- **Embarrassment** — Asking customers for money is culturally uncomfortable, especially elders and relatives
- **Helplessness** — Knows paper systems fail but sees no alternative within his reach
- **Fear of technology** — Worried about losing data, making mistakes, or being scammed through an app
- **Isolation** — No access to formal business advice, banking, or financial tools

#### 🗣️ SAYS & DOES

- Writes customer names and amounts in a small notebook (cahier) — entries often incomplete
- Gives credit to 60-70% of regular customers based on trust and social pressure
- Counts cash manually at end of day, often interrupted — loses track
- Calls customers to remind them of debts — sometimes successful, sometimes creates tension
- Buys stock from Madina Market based on gut feel, not data
- Charges his phone at the nearest charging station (not always available)
- Uses WhatsApp daily for family and some supplier communication

### Key Insight

> Ibrahima's #1 pain is not accounting — it's **debt recovery**. He extends credit because he must (competitive pressure + social norms), but he has no reliable system to track or collect it. A tool that simply helps him **prove what people owe and send gentle reminders** would transform his cash flow overnight.

### Jobs to Be Done

| Job | Current Solution | Frustration Level |
|-----|-----------------|-------------------|
| Track who owes me money | Paper notebook | 🔴 Critical — pages lost, entries incomplete |
| Remind customers to pay | Phone calls, face-to-face | 🔴 Critical — socially awkward, inconsistent |
| Know my daily profit | Mental math at end of day | 🟡 High — never accurate, often skipped |
| Decide what stock to buy | Gut feel + habit | 🟡 Medium — leads to overstock/stockout |
| Prove business income | Nothing — no records | 🟠 Latent — matters when seeking credit |

### Technology Comfort Level

| Capability | Comfort |
|-----------|---------|
| Make/receive calls | ✅ Confident |
| WhatsApp messaging | ✅ Confident |
| WhatsApp voice notes | ✅ Confident |
| Take photos | ✅ Basic |
| Browse internet | ⚠️ Limited |
| Install apps from Play Store | ⚠️ Needs help |

## Persona 2: Mariama — The Market Woman

### Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | Mariama Camara |
| **Age** | 45 |
| **Location** | Cosa, Ratoma commune, Conakry |
| **Ethnicity / Language** | Susu — speaks Susu natively, conversational Pular, no French |
| **Education** | No formal schooling — learned to count and do basic arithmetic from her mother |
| **Business** | Open-air stall selling vegetables, condiments, and household items |
| **Revenue** | ~1.5-3 million GNF/month (~$170-350 USD) |
| **Phone** | Tecno Pop 7, basic Android, often runs out of storage |
| **Connectivity** | Minimal — uses WiFi at home when available, otherwise offline |
| **Mobile Money** | Uses Orange Money for receiving transfers; her son helps with transactions |
| **Family** | Widowed, 6 children, eldest son (19) helps manage stock |

### Empathy Map

#### 👁️ SEES

- Customers buying small quantities daily — 500 GNF of pepper, 1000 GNF of onions
- Money constantly flowing in and out in small amounts that are impossible to track mentally
- Competitors offering credit to steal her regular customers
- Her son using his phone for everything — games, music, social media

#### 👂 HEARS

- "Tantie, je te paie ce soir" — promises that often go unfulfilled
- Other market women complaining about the same debt problems
- Her son saying "there's an app for everything now"
- Stories of people getting scammed through phone apps

#### 💭 THINKS & BELIEVES

- "I can't read or write, so any app would be useless for me"
- "My son could help me set things up but I need to be able to use it alone"
- "I know exactly how much Fatoumata owes me — it's all in my head" (but she sometimes forgets)
- "I don't want to pay for something I don't understand"
- "If it's truly simple like using WhatsApp, maybe I could try it"

#### 😔 FEELS (Pain Points)

- **Cognitive overload** — Tracks 20-40 customer debts mentally; makes errors
- **Vulnerability** — Cannot read contracts or written receipts; depends on others for anything written
- **Pride** — Doesn't want to appear ignorant or incapable
- **Distrust** — Has heard of phone scams; hesitant about anything that asks for personal info
- **Financial pressure** — Thin margins; every lost debt directly impacts her family's meals

#### 🗣️ SAYS & DOES

- Memorizes customer debts — uses physical cues (knotted strings, stone counting) as reminders
- Asks her son to read any text messages she receives
- Pays cash for everything — doesn't trust digital payments for outgoing money
- Negotiates prices verbally; all business is done through conversation
- Trusts voice and visual information over written text

### Key Insight

> Mariama represents the **zero-literacy segment** — the hardest to serve but potentially the most impactful. She needs a tool that works **entirely through icons, voice, and color coding**. If she can record "Fatoumata — red (owes money)" by tapping a picture and hearing a confirmation, that's transformative. Text-based UIs are a non-starter.

### Jobs to Be Done

| Job | Current Solution | Frustration Level |
|-----|-----------------|-------------------|
| Remember who owes me what | Mental tracking, physical cues | 🔴 Critical — errors cost her money weekly |
| Get paid what I'm owed | Face-to-face confrontation | 🔴 Critical — social friction is high |
| Know if today was profitable | Rough mental estimate | 🟡 High — no clarity |
| Teach my children the business | Oral tradition | 🟡 Medium — no records to pass on |

### Empathy Map

#### 👁️ SEES

- The gap between how he runs his shop and how proper businesses operate

#### 👂 HEARS

- Podcasts and YouTube videos about entrepreneurship in Africa

- Friends talking about M-Pesa success in East Africa

#### 💭 THINKS & BELIEVES

- **Frustration with existing tools** — Has tried Excel on his phone; too complex, not designed for his workflow

### Key Insight

> Ousmane is your **early adopter and evangelist**. He's tech-comfortable enough to onboard himself, ambitious enough to see the value immediately, and socially connected enough to bring other boutiquiers along. He's also the persona most likely to eventually pay for premium features. Target him first.

### Jobs to Be Done

| Job | Current Solution | Frustration Level |
|-----|-----------------|-------------------|
| Track all transactions digitally | Notes app + notebook | 🔴 Critical — duplicated, messy |
| Understand profit margins by product | Mental estimation | 🟡 High — can't optimize stock |
| Build financial history for credit access | Nothing | 🟠 Latent — huge future value |
| Manage supplier payments and balances | Memory + Orange Money history | 🟡 High |
| Grow customer base and loyalty | Word of mouth | 🟡 Medium |

## Persona 4: Amadou — The Ambulant (Walking Vendor)

### Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | Amadou Soumah |
| **Age** | 22 |
| **Location** | Roams Matoto, Ratoma, and Kaloum communes, Conakry |
| **Ethnicity / Language** | Susu — speaks Susu natively, basic French for commerce |
| **Education** | Completed middle school (collège) — reads and writes basic French |
| **Business** | Walking vendor selling phone accessories, household goods, and small electronics from a basket/cart |
| **Revenue** | ~1-2 million GNF/month (~$115-230 USD) |
| **Phone** | Itel A05s, Android Go, 1GB RAM, cracked screen protector |
| **Connectivity** | Prepaid Orange data — buys small bundles, intermittent 3G/4G |
| **Mobile Money** | Uses Orange Money for receiving payments from some customers |
| **Family** | Single, supports his mother and younger sister |

### Empathy Map

#### 👁️ SEES

- Customers buying small items throughout the day — 500 GNF charger, 2000 GNF earphones, 5000 GNF phone case
- Cash flowing in and out in tiny amounts that blur together by evening
- Other ambulants who gave up because they couldn't tell if they were making money
- Fixed-shop boutiquiers who seem to have a better handle on their business
- Neighborhoods where he sells well and others where he wastes time walking

#### 👂 HEARS

- Regular customers saying "I'll pay you next time I see you" — and he may not see them for days
- His mother asking how much he made today — and he can't give a clear answer
- Other ambulants talking about good selling spots and bad days
- Stories of ambulants who saved enough to open a fixed shop

#### 💭 THINKS & BELIEVES

- "I sell a lot of small things but I don't know if I'm actually making money"
- "If I could see my numbers, I could figure out which products to stock more of"
- "I give credit to a few regulars but it's small amounts — I mostly forget"
- "I need something quick — I can't stop to write things down while walking"
- "An app could work if it's really fast — I'm comfortable with my phone"

#### 😔 FEELS (Pain Points)

- **Blindness** — Sells 50+ items a day in small amounts; has no idea what the total is until he counts cash at night (and the count is never right)
- **Doubt** — Can't tell if his business is growing, shrinking, or breaking even
- **Frustration** — Knows he loses track of small credits given to regulars in neighborhoods
- **Restocking anxiety** — Buys stock based on gut feel; sometimes overstocks items that don't sell, runs out of popular ones
- **Fatigue** — Long days walking; wants a simple tool, not another chore

#### 🗣️ SAYS & DOES

- Sells from a basket or pushcart, moving between neighborhoods, bus stations, and markets
- Handles 30-60 small transactions a day, almost all in cash
- Gives occasional credit to regulars he encounters repeatedly in certain neighborhoods
- Counts cash at end of day but the total never matches his memory of sales
- Uses WhatsApp confidently; navigates apps but prefers minimal text and fast interactions
- Dreams of saving enough to open a fixed kiosk or boutique

### Key Insight

> Amadou's #1 pain is **not knowing if he made money today**. He sells dozens of small items daily but has zero visibility into his totals, margins, or trends. He doesn't need a debt ledger — he needs a **pocket sales counter** that lets him tap each sale as it happens and shows him the daily total. Credit tracking is secondary for him; sales visibility is everything.

### Jobs to Be Done

| Job | Current Solution | Frustration Level |
|-----|-----------------|-------------------|
| Know how much I sold today | Mental math, counting cash at night | 🔴 Critical — never accurate |
| Track which items sell best | Gut feel | 🟡 High — bad restocking decisions |
| Record credit to regulars | Memory | 🟡 Medium — smaller credit volume than kiosk |
| Know if I'm profitable | No idea | 🟡 High — can't tell if he should continue |

### Technology Comfort Level

| Capability | Comfort |
|-----------|---------|
| Make/receive calls | ✅ Confident |
| WhatsApp messaging | ✅ Confident |
| WhatsApp voice notes | ✅ Confident |
| Take photos | ✅ Confident |
| Browse internet | ✅ Basic |
| Install apps from Play Store | ✅ Basic |
| Navigate app with icons | ✅ Confident |
| Type on keyboard | ⚠️ Slow but functional |

## Cross-Persona Empathy Synthesis

### Universal Pain Points (All Four Personas Share)

1. **No financial visibility** — None of them truly know how much they sell in a day or if their business is profitable
2. **Debt tracking is broken** — Paper, memory, and mental math all fail at scale
3. **Debt collection is socially painful** — Asking for money creates friction in tight-knit communities
4. **Technology feels exclusionary** — Apps are designed for educated, connected, French-speaking users
5. **Trust is everything** — They won't adopt anything that feels risky or exposes their business data

### Persona Prioritization Matrix

| Persona | Adoption Difficulty | Impact if Served | Virality Potential | **MVP Priority** |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Ousmane** (Connected) | 🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 **High** — will evangelize | **🥇 Seed user** |
| **Amadou** (Ambulant) | 🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 **High** — evangelizes in ambulant networks | **🥇 Seed user** |
| **Ibrahima** (Typical) | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 **High** — largest segment | 🟡 Medium — word of mouth | **🥈 Primary target** |
| **Mariama** (Zero-literacy) | 🔴 High | 🔴 **High** — most underserved | 🟡 Medium — market networks | **🥉 V2 expansion** |

### Recommended Adoption Strategy

**Phase 1 — Seed (Month 1-2):** Recruit 30-50 Ousmanes in 2-3 Conakry neighborhoods (Matoto, Ratoma, Dixinn) AND 20-30 Amadous in ambulant networks around bus stations and markets. Two entry points: connected boutiquiers adopt for full ledger functionality, ambulants adopt for the quick sales counter. Both groups onboard themselves, provide feedback, and evangelize in their networks.

**Phase 2 — Bridge (Month 2-4):** Ousmanes help onboard Ibrahimas in their networks. Amadous spread the word to fellow ambulants. The app must be simple enough that Ousmane can teach Ibrahima in 5 minutes at the kiosk, and that an ambulant can record a sale while walking.

**Phase 3 — Expand (Month 4-8):** With voice/icon features mature, begin reaching Mariamas through market women's associations and radio promotion in Susu.

## Design Implications from Empathy Research

### Non-Negotiable UX Principles

| Principle | Rationale | Implementation |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Icon-first, text-second** | 60%+ of target users have limited literacy | Every action has a visual icon; text is supplementary |
| **Voice input/output** | Mariama can't type; Ibrahima types very slowly | Record customer names via voice; hear balances read aloud |
| **Offline-native** | Connectivity is intermittent and expensive | All core features work without internet; sync when available |
| **1-2 tap maximum for core action** | Attention span is short; interruptions are constant | Quick cash sale: Tap amount → Done (1 tap). Credit sale: Tap customer → Tap amount → Done (2 taps) |
| **No registration wall** | Any friction at entry = abandonment | Start using immediately; optional account creation later |
| **GNF-native** | All amounts in Guinean Francs, no decimals | Large round numbers (500, 1000, 5000, 10000 GNF) |
| **WhatsApp integration** | Only universal digital channel in Guinea | Send debt reminders via WhatsApp (low social friction) (V2) |
| **Dark mode default** | Many users charge phones infrequently; saves battery | Default to dark theme on AMOLED screens |

### Emotional Design Considerations

- **Never make the user feel stupid** — Error messages should be icons + audio, never technical text
- **Celebrate small wins** — "You recovered 50,000 GNF this week" (voice notification)
- **Respect social dynamics** — Debt reminders must be gentle, culturally appropriate, and from the app (not directly from the shopkeeper) to reduce personal tension
- **Build trust gradually** — Start with local storage only; introduce cloud sync as a later opt-in feature
- **Support the notebook mental model** — The app should feel like a better version of their cahier, not a foreign accounting system
